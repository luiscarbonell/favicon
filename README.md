When interpreting `index.html` be aware of the following:

* `[path_to_asset]`: The relative path to the asset ===> `"/img/logo/logo.png"`
* `[version]`: The new version number of the asset - if the asset has been modified ===> `"/img/logo/logo.png?v=1234"`

_NOTE: If the asset has not been modified, or this is the first time the asset is rendered by your server, the version number can be omitted._
